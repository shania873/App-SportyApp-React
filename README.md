SportyApp is built in React using Hooks (still in development).

# What is SportyApp ?

SportyApp is an application where three personas can connect: the trainer, the client, and the superadmin.

The trainer can log in to SportyApp to publish the lessons they want to offer, including a photo, the address, and a description of the lessons. After that, the client can log in to the app to subscribe to the lessons.
